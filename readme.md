Running in my docker environment https://ibm.dunnbydesign.us/ 

This is the test requested by IBM

I decided to use the REAN stack (redis express angularjs node)

To run the application locally is pretty simple

Install Vagrant and use https://github.com/mdevilliers/vagrant-redis (or however you want to do redis)

grab this repo 

Install Karma-CLI for testing

run the following command

```npm run start```

OR

```npm run test``` 

to run karma test

I build it to be very lightweight though I believe I hit all the bonus points.
No generator was used in the making of this app but I would totally use one otherwise YO!
